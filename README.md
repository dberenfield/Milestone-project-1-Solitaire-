Title of Project  
Solitaire



Description

_(Replace this text with a brief description of your game and what inspired you to make it.)_
I grew up playing solitaire cause I had no friends to play cards with, Iâ€™d love to immortalize this game out of respect to myself and the tradition of cards

Game Logic

The writing here should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game:


Describe the logic involved in player decisions.
 		 - What are the choices available to the player? What cards to pick using logic to avoid getting stuck in game ending situations, making decisions to keep options open
 - What happens when the player makes a choice?
The order of cards gets altered and they get closer to winning or losing the game.

Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status.
If all of the cards are stacked in order on their designated suit then the player
______________________________________________________________
Wins the game. If there are no more options left with the cards usable at the time 
______________________________________________________________
	Then the player loses.
