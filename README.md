Title of Project  
Solitaire



Description

I grew up playing solitaire because it's an easy game you can play by yourself. Iâ€™d love to immortalize this game out of respect to myself and the tradition of cards

Game Logic

The writing here should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game:
Move cards around in three ways. One, by playing cards of a different color on top of a card that is one number higher. Two, by playing cards onto the foundation piles. Foundation piles are started with the ace in each suit and can be played on in sequence up to the king in each suit. Three, reveal a card from the deck. Cards can be revealed one at a time for easier game play or reveal every third card for a more challenging game. 
Continue to move cards around in these three ways until all cards are moved to the foundation piles (win), or there are no more moves to be made (lose).

 - What happens when the player makes a choice?
The order of cards gets altered and they get closer to winning or losing the game.

Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status.
If all of the cards are stacked in order on their designated suit then the player
Wins the game. If there are no more options left with the cards usable at the time 
Then the player loses.
